## User Experience (UX) 

### User Stories :scroll:


When designing my user stories I used the Agile MoSCoW prioritisation technique and designed the user story table to help keep the project on track. The meaning of each label can be found in the key below. :point_down:

**Key:**

|Label| Definition|
|-----------------|-----------|
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Must%20Have-green">|Requirement is necessary for the project to be conisdered as successfully completeted.|
|<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Should%20Have-blueviolet"> |Requirement is important but not neccessary for the project to be conisdered as successfully completeted.
|<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Could%20Have-yellow"> |Requirement is a bonus to the project and if not included the impacts are less significant that a 'must have' or 'should have'.|
|<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Wont%20Have-red">| Requirement are not considered as a priority for the project, given the timeframe but may be revistited when implementing future features.|

**Table:**

The Table below shows the user stories for this project. These user stories ID links to the issue number displayed in the Kanban board (can be found in the projects sectiion) and does not reflect the order in which these stories where completed.

The Stories in the Kanban board contain the agreed acceptance criteria in the form of tasks so that an agile technique is used to track the development of the user stories and the project itself.


|User Story ID|User Type|User Story|Priority|

**Kanban Board**

Below :point_down: are screenshot of the Kanban board, all stories witin the scope of this project have been completed. The Stories that will not be implemented in this release have been closed as wont fix and moved to the backlog, where they may be reconsidered for future releases.

<img src="static/images/Kanban_Board.png" alt="Kanban Board" width="450px" height="250px">

### Design :art:

The main goal was to make an intuitive UX, so that the user is not confused when visiting the Website. To achieve this, I created a simple, succinct, web application. The navabar is present on every page with clear icons for easy navigation.

The user experience should be tailored. To ensure this navbar items vary based on whether the user is authenticated, so that users who are not logged in aren't shown features that are not available to them.

If a user tries to access a page they are not auhtorised to, they are informed why they can't see the page and a link is provided so that they can rectify the issue in one click. 

All user actions shoud return a response. To ensure this is possible there are specific success and error messages displayed as result of a user action. Page redirects are also used to make it obvious that an action has been successfully completed.


**• Colour scheme**

   ° I have gone for a simple beige (#e5c6a0) , as this is a neutral but trendy colour. To enusre accessibility for all users I used a monchrome design for the text. All  text and Icons are displayed in black text (#ffffff) on a white card (#000000).To find the shade of beige that offers the best contrast with these font colours I used [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). 


**• Typography**

   ° In keeping with the minimalistic style of the website, I have chosen to use an original fixed-width type family font 'Space Mono' as it was developed for editorial use in headline and display typography. Tying in with the purpose of the web application. 
   
   ° I want the users to be carefree whislt using the site as the purpose of the site is to alow the users to share/explore different ideas and connect with like minded individuals. The style of 'Space Mono' makes it easy to read and fosters the care free vibe, I want the users to experience. 


**• Imagery**

   ° The default blog images was created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com)

   ° The icons used throughout the site are [Boostrap](https://unpkg.com/boxicons@2.0.9/css/boxicons.min.css') icons

   ° The logo was created using [Tailor Brands](https://www.tailorbrands.com/logo-maker) 


**• Wireframes**

   ° Wireframes were created using figma. To meet my UX objective of creating a simple and intuitive User Interface (UI), I took a minimalisitic approach with the wireframes, to provide flexibility so that the project can evolve in accordance with user feedback. Without straying from the mnimilistic theme. Here is the link to [my wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/f2grvaqVv3paHrMBZUmhah/Ms4) for desktop and mobile. After listening to user feedback during the project; further features were added, so not all features are represented in the wireframes. However, all [features](##Features) will be discussed later in the README. Below are screenshots of the desktop and mobile Wireframes. :point_down: 

   **Home screen** - screenshot for Desktop :desktop_computer: and Mobile :iphone:

   When viewing posts by category the same layout will be used, so a seperate wireframe was not created for that page. 

   <img src="static/images/Home-wireframe.png" alt="Home-Wireframe" width="550px" height="350px">

   **Forms**  - screenshot for Desktop :desktop_computer: and Mobile :iphone:

   All the forms used in this web application have a uniform style and appear on a seperate page.

   <img src="static/images/Forms-Wireframe.png" alt="Forms-Wireframe" width="550px" height="350px">
   
## Features 

As previously explained (:point_up: ) new features were added during the project in response to user feedback. I will be explaining the current features, breaking them down into main and bonus features to help demostrate the progression of the project. Some future features will also be discussed.

**Site User**

First I will be looking at the features for site users

## Testing :test_tube:

### Code Validation
• W3C HTML Validator - [Passed](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbloggerverse.herokuapp.com%2F)
   
  click the hyperlink above to view my results. :point_up_2:	


• W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator - [Passed](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbloggerverse.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

  click the hyperlink above to view my results. :point_up_2:	

• JsHint- [Passed](https://jshint.com/)

  click the hyperlink above to view my results. :point_up_2:

  ° I only used a few lines of JS, but had two warnings about renaming. No errors were found.

• Python - Passed

  Initially I had quite a few errors relating to line spacing and line length. These have since been corrected and there are no errors in my workspace. All python code is PEP8 compliant, unless it is not possible to do so(explained below). I have tested the code in all of the files listed below :point_down: using a [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) validator and I used the [pydocstyle](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting#_pydocstyle) linter extension in vscode.

  The settings.py file returned two errors due to Django rules allowing longer line lengths (88 characters) than PEP8 (79 charcaters. 

  This is shown in the screenshot below :point_down:

  <img src="static/images/settings.png" alt="line too long" width="550px" height="350px">

  The Django-Heroku package I have used in my project is also causing an error as it must be importaed at the end of the file, this goes against PEP8 rules but have passed validation using a DJango lynter. 

  This is shown in the screenshots below :point_down:

### Performance testing
   
   To ensure peformance was tested exstensively, I used two tools

  **•Lighthouse testing**
  The overall performance of my webpage is good but there is room for improvement in best practices. As seen in the screenshot below. 

   <img src="static/images/lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse testing results" width="550px" height="350px">

    The low score in this area is due to cloudinary files been passed over http instead of https. I have not found a way to change this on the free plan (current plan i am using). Although for future projects I will ensure https is used.

    jquery was also used in this project, this is a library that has known security risk. I will not be using jquery for future projects to maintain best practices. 

  **•WeppageTest**

  I used webpage testing to conduct performance testing across a range of emulated devices, my results were the same across all devices tested. The results from a Motorola G (gen 4) - 4G can be seen [here](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/220623_AiDcF6_E5A/2/performance_optimization/).
  
##### Browser Compatibility

The above HTML and CSS Validators test for valid code that is compatible with all browsers.


The following functions were tested on the following browsers using a pass / fail system:

• OS compatibility was tested on iOS 14.8, Android 11, ipadOS 15, Windows 10 and MacOS Monterey.

• The devices used include but are not exclusive to Macbook Pro, iphone XR, HTC 11, iphone 11Pro and iPad air. To ensure the website was thoroughly tested I used [Chrome Dev Tools ](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)to test on a range of viewports from 320px up to 2560px.

 ### User testing :bust_in_silhouette:

• I shared the web app with family and friends of varying ages and computing skills to test the ease of navigation on a variety of devices. There were no issues with navigation.

• I also used testers to check that all buttons were working and there were no broken links. No broken links were found but there were a few no reverse errors, these issues have been corrected. After corrections were made I asked for them to be tested again and everything was working as expected.

#### User story testing  

As demonstrated by the table below :point_down:, all intended user stories have been implemented. Screenshots of the relevant features can be seen in the [features](## Features) sectio above :point_up:

## Deployment

As previously mentioned this project was developed using a [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/next-chapter-for-gitpod)workspace. The code was committed to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the terminal. The code was then remotely deployed to Heroku.

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this blog app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bmcdonald2000/bloggerverse),the following steps were taken:

1. Create the Heroku App:

  • Select `Create new app` in Heroku.
  • Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Attach the Postgres database:

  • In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file:

  • In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the URL next to DATABASE_URL.
  
  • In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
  
  • Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.

  • Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
  
  • Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.

  • Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary URL, adding into the settings.py file also.

  • In settings.py add the following sections:

    ° STATIC_URL
    ° STATICFILES_DIRS
    ° MEDIA_URL
    ° MEDIA_ROOT
    ° TEMPLATES_DIR
    ° Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
    ° Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']

4. Set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and Deploy to Heroku:

  • Create two directories for your static files (add a subfile for each file type) and templates (if multiple apps used create a seperate nested template file for each additional app to prevent confusion).


  • Create a file named `Procfile` in the main directory and add the following:

    ° `web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi`
  
  • In the terminal, log in to Heroku and then enter the following:

    ° `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app (Heroku App Name)`

  • Go to the `Deploy` tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository. Click on `Deploy Branch` and wait for the build to load. When the build is complete, the app can be opened through Heroku.

## Known bugs

• There are currently no known bugs. However I did have some issues during the project, solutions to these issues have been highlighted using "fix:" commits.
